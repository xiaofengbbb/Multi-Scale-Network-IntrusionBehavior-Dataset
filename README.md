# Multi-Scale-Network-IntrusionBehavior-Dataset

## We construct a novel multi-scale network intrusion behavior dataset including three attack scales (light, medium, and heavy) and two multi-scale attack patterns based on probability distributions (normal distribution and exponential distribution)

The dataset constructed in this paper includes 16 CSV files. The dataset provides information on three attack scales (light, medium, and heavy) and two multi-scale attack patterns based on probability distributions (normal distribution and exponential distribution). Additionally, the dataset includes characterization of benign network traffic. Each file corresponds to specific combinations of an attack tool, attack scale, or attack pattern based on probability distributions.

## This repository is a usable example of this dataset
